    "description": "Our class has decided to contribute to the Mara Elephant Project. The goal of this project is to reduce human-elephant conflict. Due to human population growth and deforestation, humans are encroaching upon historic elephant rangelands.\nHuman-elephant conflict, paired with the rising demand for ivory, leads to the illegal killing of elephants. If measures are not taken, the elephant population will become extinct causing other detrimental effects to the ecosystem.\nThe money we raise to support the project will pay for tracking devices that notify rangers when elephants start moving faster, a sign that poachers are nearby.",
