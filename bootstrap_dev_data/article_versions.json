First there is the Caribbean coast. It is very hot. It has beautiful beaches. People here eat fish, rice, and plantain. Cartagena is a city here. Cartagena is an old city. It has colorful buildings. It is surrounded by a big wall.\n\nTo the east there is the Guajira desert. It is very dry. The Wayuu people live there. They make colorful bags. The biggest city is Cabo de la Vela. It is on the coast. There is good kite-surfing there.\n\nNow let’s go south. The elevation gets higher. The land becomes greener. It is colder. A city here is Medellin. It is in the mountains. It has cable-cars. These are like buses in the sky. At night, the mountains light up. It is the lights of houses. They look like stars.\n\nLet’s go further south. There is the Zona Cafetera. This means coffee-making region. There are many green hills. There are many small towns. Some towns are Salento, Jardin, and Finlandia. In these towns, people drink lots of tinto. This is black coffee with sugar. They drink it all day. They even drink it at night./n/nLet’s go further south. There is the Valle del Cauca. It is hot here. There are lots of sugar cane farms. These farms smell very good. The capital of the valley is called Cali. Cali is crazy about salsa. There is salsa music everywhere. There are over 200 salsa schools. There are even more discotecas. These are places where people dance at night.\n\nLet’s go west of Cali. There  is Buenaventura. Buenaventura is on the pacific coast. There are no roads to the Pacific coast. You have to go by boat. This makes it unique. There are lots of beaches. There are lots of jungles. There are not many people.\n\nLet’s go east of Cali. There are big mountains. They are above 9000 feet. The Purace volcano is above 15000 feet. Many people hike here.\n\nLet’s go further east. There is a valley. It is hot. It has a desert. It is called the Tatacoa desert. The stars are easy to see. There are cool rocks.\n\nColombia has a lot to offer. There is a lot I didn’t mention, too. There are the Llanos. These are ranch-lands. They are in the east. There’s also the Amazon. The Amazon covers 1/3 of the country. And there’s Bogota. Bogota is the nation’s capital. There is even more too. Maybe one day you will see some of it.",

It seems like all of these things couldn’t exist in one single country, right? Wrong. In Colombia, all of this and more can be found. Let’s take a trip around this diverse country and see what we find.\n\nLet’s start in the north. First there is the Caribbean coast. This region is very hot. It has beautiful beaches. The typical dish here is fish, rice with coconut, and pressed plantain. One of the most famous cities of this region is Cartagena. Cartagena is an old colonial city filled with colorful buildings. It is surrounded on four sides by a great wall from colonial times.\n\nTo the east there is the Guajira desert. It is a big piece of dry land and sand dunes. La Guajira is home to the Wayuu people. They are known for their colorful hand-made bags. The biggest city here is called Cabo de la Vela. It is on the coast at the edge of the desert. It is famous for its great kite-surfing.\n\nNow going south, we start to climb in elevation. The land becomes much greener and a bit colder. Eventually, we get to the beautiful city of Medellin. Medellin is a big city in the mountains. You can take cable-car rides between neighborhoods high above the city. At night time, you can see the lights of the houses in the mountains.

They drink it at all times of the day, even late at night.\n\nContinuing further south still, we get to the Valle del Cauca. This is a hot valley with lots of sugar cane farms. These farms give off a sweet, warm smell that welcomes everyone driving through. The capital of the valley is called Cali. It is known as the world’s capital of salsa. Cali is crazy about salsa. No matter what part of the city you’re in, you’ll probably hear salsa music coming from some restaurant. There are over 200 salsa schools in the city. There are even more discotecas where people dance every night of the week. \n\nTo the west of Cali is the port of Buenaventura. This is the gateway to Colombia’s pacific coast. There are almost no roads going to the Pacific coast. The only way to get to most places here is by boat. This makes the Pacific coast different from the rest of the country. Think of long stretches of black beaches and dark jungles with few people.\n\nTo the east of Cali there are big mountains. A lot of the land is above 9000 feet. The Purace volcano is above 15000 feet. Many people go to this region to hike and enjoy nature.\n\nFurther east, past the mountains, there is a hot valley. Here there is the Tatacoa desert.

Many people go to this region to hike and enjoy nature.\n\nFurther east still, the mountains drop off, giving way to an incredibly hot valley. This valley is home to the blindingly hot Tatacoa desert.

The movie was called Searching for Bobby Fischer. It was based on a book. Josh’s dad wrote the book. It was about Josh. Josh was famous. He didn’t like it. He wanted to play chess. Something else happened. Josh was 18. He got a new coach. Josh played aggressively. This coach made him play differently. He played less aggressively. Josh didn’t like this. It felt bad. He liked chess less.\n\nThen he started Tai Chi. He was 21. This was important. His life changed. He fell in love with it. He started competing. He became a national champion.  He won 5 national championships. He won a world championship. \n\nJosh learned from chess and Tai Chi. He wrote a book. The book is called The Art of Learning.\n\nHe also helps people learn.

By the time he was 9, he was the best chess player in the country for his age. At 11, he drew a game with Garry Kasparov, thought by some to be the greatest chess player of all time. Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Waitzkin was consistently the best chess player in the United States for his age and one of the best in the world.

This film was based on Josh’s father’s book about Josh’s early chess career. It’s release created mobs of fans, envious opponents, and mounting pressure.

By nature, Josh was an aggressive player who thrived on creating chaos on the board and then navigating through the chaos. At 18, Josh took on a teacher who forced him to study the more defensive masters of the game.

He started to notice many similarities between chess and Tai Chi. For example, the strategic sequences of moves he would practice in Tai Chi felt like chess strategies. As another example, he would deal with the great complexity in each art similarly. That is, he would focus on small details until they became second-nature to him. Then, he would forget about the details so that he could focus on the larger game. These are just two of many similarities.

Threes changed basketball.\n\nThere weren’t always threes. They started in 1945. It was a college game. Then they went to the NBA. This was in 1979. First people didn’t shoot many threes. Now they do.\n\nLet’s see why. The 3-point percentage is 36%. The 2-point percentage is 46%. Imagine a player shoots 100 shots. Let’s say he shoots threes. He’ll make about 36. So, he’ll have 108 points. What if he shoots twos? He’ll make about 46. So, he’ll have 92 points. So, shooting threes is good.\n\nThis has changed basketball. There are more layups and threes. There are fewer big centers. Teams spread out their offenses. They put more people outside. They put less inside. \n\nSome people like threes. They think threes are exciting. Threes make comebacks easier. \n\nOther people don’t like threes. They think threes are boring. They think threes aren’t basketball. Greg Popovich doesn’t like threes. He is the Spurs’ coach. He said, “I still hate it. I’ll never like it. I don’t think it’s basketball.”\n\nThrees are important. People will keep shooting threes. They might add 4-pointers. Steph Curry would like this.

    "article_text": "In basketball, shots are worth different amounts of points. It depends where you shoot from. If you make a basket from inside the “3-point line,” it’s worth 2 points. If you make one from outside the 3-point line, it’s worth 3 points. But it wasn’t always this way. In the beginning, every basket was worth two points. Later, the 3-point line was added. This rule change has had a big impact on basketball. It will impact the future of basketball too.\n\nFirst some history. The 3-point shot was first used in a college game in 1945. Then it was used in professional leagues. In 1979, it was used by the NBA. It has stuck ever since.\n\nThe use of threes has increased a lot. In 1979, teams shot just under 3 threes per game. Ten years later, they shot 6.5 per game. Today, they shoot 27 per game. \n\nLet’s see why. The 3-point percentage is 36%. The 2-point percentage is 46%. Imagine a player shoots 100 shots. Let’s say he shoots threes. Then he’ll make 36 on average. So, he’ll have 108 points. What happens if he shoots twos? Then, he’ll make 46 on average. So, he’ll have 92 points. So, it seems like a good idea to shoot threes.\n\nThe best teams realized this. Look at the 4 teams in the Conference Finals last year. The Warriors shot the least threes out of all four teams! They were 6th in the league in threes attempted. The other 3 teams were 1, 2, and 3. \n\nThis has changed the game. People don’t shoot from medium distance anymore. There are more layups and threes. There are fewer big centers. There are more slim big men who can shoot threes. Teams spread out their offenses more. They put more people on the perimeter. They put less people close to the basket. \n\nPeople have different opinions about threes. Some people like threes. They think threes are exciting. Also, threes make comebacks easier. Some people like that.\n\nOther people don’t like threes. Threes cause less teamwork. Threes also take away variety. Just threes and layups, with nothing in-between. Some people think threes aren’t basketball. Spurs coach Greg Popovich said, “I still hate it. I’ll never like it. I don’t think it’s basketball. I think it’s kind of like a circus sort of thing.”\n\nLike it or not, it seems the 3 is here to stay. It’s more important today than ever before. That’s not likely to change. They might even add a 4-point line. I’m sure Steph Curry wouldn’t mind. Would you?",

He studied in Honolulu until he graduated high school in the year 1979.\n\nAs soon as he was done with high school, Obama went to the Occidental College in Los Angeles.

It was only a matter of time before he rose through the ranks there. He became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review in his second year.\n\nWhen Obama graduated in 1991, he was already a sort of hero – mostly for his part in driving racial recognitions in roles where they were usually not acknowledged.\n\n Five years later, Obama was elected to the Senate in Illinois. In his time there, he oversaw many reforms. He negotiated better welfare for the people. He improved tax credits for low income earners. He lobbied for increased subsidies in childcare.\n\n He would retain his seat in the Illinois senate in the 1998 election, gaining another re-election in 2002. That made the year 2000 the only time he ever lost in the race to the senate.\n\n After sponsoring a lot of bills and co-sponsoring others, Obama announced his candidacy for president in 2008.

He committed to his goals.\n\nGandhi was born to a middle-class family. His dad’s name was Karamchand. He was chief minister of their state. Karamchand had 4 wives in his life. Mohandas was born to the fourth of these wives. Her name was Putlibai. Putlibai was very religious. She had a big influence on Mohandas. She would often not eat for two or three days at a time. She would never eat without praying.\n\nMohandas was an average student. He didn’t have many friends. He got married at 13. His parents arranged the marriage. His wife was 14. Her name was Kasturbai. Mohandas and Kasturbai had their first child when he was 16. The child survived only a few days. In this same year, Mohandas’ father died. These deaths made Mohandas very sad.\n\nAt age 18, Gandhi left India. He went to London to study law. He came back to India at age 22. He didn’t have much success as a lawyer. A year later, he took a job as a lawyer in South Africa. Gandhi ended up staying 21 years there. These years changed Gandhi.  He learned a lot.\n\nHe made a strategy called “Satyagraha.” This means “soul-force”. In Satyagraha, people went on peaceful marches. They also got arrested. This was to protest unfair laws. Gandhi used Satyagraha to gain many important rights for Indians in South Africa. They started calling him “Mahatma.” This means “Great Soul.”\n\nIn 1914, Gandhi went back to India. India was ruled by Great Britain. He led several peaceful protests for Indian rights against the British. He used Satyagraha. His first major achievement came in 1917. He helped indian farmers win an argument against the British. This was called the “Champaran Agitations.” In 1918, he helped the people of Kheda. Kheda was dealing with a flood and famine. He helped them get relief from taxes.\n\nGandhi thought of another strategy. It was called “non-cooperation.” He told people not to use British goods. He told people to quit government jobs.

He was shot and killed in 1948.\n\nGandhi will be remembered for a long time. He will always be remembered as the man who freed India. Perhaps more important, though, is the way he did it.

    "article_text": "When you see the word “math,” what do you think of? Many people think of adding and subtracting numbers, or of solving complicated equations. While these are certainly sometimes part of math, they are by no means the whole thing. Math is a very broad field that deals with the investigation of many different types of “mathematical objects,” of which numbers are just one example.\n\nSo, if math is the study of “mathematical objects,” what exactly is a mathematical object? While difficult to define, they are usually just objects of interest that come from daily life, other sciences, or math itself. Then, mathematicians try to strip these objects down and define them in very simple terms. They make them simple enough to understand, while complicated enough to still be interesting.\n\nIt’s probably easier to see what math “is” by giving a few examples of the different areas of math. One very broad branch of mathematics is called “abstract algebra” or simply “algebra.” Algebra studies the properties of things called groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and more. All of these mathematical objects consist of a bunch of “things” and a rule or set of rules for how these things “interact” with each other. Usually, the motivation for defining these objects comes from something familiar from daily life. For example, the “natural numbers” (0, 1, 2, 3, etc) along with the rules “addition” and “multiplication” are a ring. The real numbers (not just 0, 1, 2, and 3, but also 2.11, 6.5334325, etc) along with the rules “addition” and “multiplication” are a field. So, we start out by defining these objects based on the stuff we know from real life. Then, once we have the definitions, we learn things about the objects in general. We also learn about other examples of these objects that don’t come so obviously from real life.\n\nOne important part of algebra is called “linear algebra.” Linear algebra is just the study of objects called “vector spaces” and “linear transformations.” Vector spaces are kind of like the 3-dimensional space we live in, but a bit more general. Linear transformations are things that tell you how to get from one vector space to another. Linear algebra is a very important branch of math that is used in almost every other part of math and in many other branches of science. For example, quantum mechanics is the leading theory of physics explaining how small particles behave. It is written completely in the language of linear algebra.\n\nAnother important branch of math is called “analysis.” This is a bit of a confusing term since we use analysis in our daily language to mean something a bit different. In math, “analysis” is just the study of functions. A function is basically just a thing that takes in a “real number” (something like 2.341) and spits out another real number (like 5.1). As you might expect, there are very many functions, so the field of analysis is a large one. Also because of its large scope, the applications of analysis are many. Just as one example, things like MP3 files (for music) and JPEG files (for pictures) use the theory of Fourier Series, which are studied in analysis, to encode their data.\n\nThese are just some of the branches of math. There is also topology, which is the study of topological spaces. These are kind of like the 3-dimensional space we live in, but a bit more general. Then there is combinatorics, which is very advanced counting. There is also number theory, which is the study of numbers, especially primes. The list goes on, and continues to expand.

    "article_text": "It is not every time that someone gets born to a family where they would find their passion, continuing in the footsteps of one of their parents. That might be one of the things which made the story of Peyton Manning unique, but that was surely not the only factor.\n\n It took hard work and determination to get the NFL quarterback where he is today.\n\n Born on the 24’th of March, 1976, Manning was the second of three boys born to Archie Manning – also a former NFL quarterback. Manning’s family was one that was heavily built around football due to the influence of their father.\n\n It could even be said that Peyton Manning started throwing a ball from the time he was old enough to pick one up. Being the older brother of Eli Manning – current quarterback for the New York Giants – he was surely not the only one to have walked this path.\n\n His interest in football might have developed in the home, but it fostered on the pitch when he started playing for his high school (Isidore Newman School, New Orleans).\n\n He showed his talent from an early age. He led his school team to an impeccable 34-5 record during all the three seasons he spent there as a starter. There, he was always wearing the No. 18 jersey to honor his older brother who gave up the game due to a spinal injury.\n\n By the time he was done with high school, Peyton became the most sought-after NFL player for colleges. In fact, he went on to be recruited by no less than 60 colleges.\n\n After careful consideration, Manning chose the University of Tennessee Volunteers among all the interested suitors. Many fans expected him to play for the same team his father did, but he planned to chart out his own course instead.\n\n When the time came to graduate college in Tennessee, he had done just that. He had become the all-time leading passer of the college and won 39/45 games. This broke the record for career wins in the Southeastern Conference (SEC).\n\n After college, Manning was selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick of the year’s draft. He would go on to play for a full 11 years before being injured in 2011.\n\n On nursing the injury to full recovery, he was released by the Colts. He proceeded to play the 2012 season with the Denver Broncos. He stayed with them until 2015. Combined, Manning played an impressive 17 seasons while excluding the years he lost to his recurrent neck injury.\n\n That time, fortunately, was enough for him to cement his name in the game as one of the greatest to have ever thrown a football. He also exemplified the role of a quarterback. He surpassed the achievements of his father and broke many records.\n\n The only blemish that Manning seems to have on his career was that he didn’t enjoy the same amount of success in the playoffs as he did in the regular season. Still, he has had a huge impact on the game.\n\n After all, he went on to become a 2-time Super Bowl champion.\n\n In honor of his immense contribution to the game, his high school retired the No. 16 jersey in his honor. His first team (Indianapolis Colts) did the same with his No. 18 shirt.\n\n Manning is also a philanthropist who has donated to many notable causes. He has helped improve the entire city of Indianapolis.",
