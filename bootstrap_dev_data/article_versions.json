First there is the Caribbean coast. It is very hot. It has beautiful beaches. People here eat fish, rice, and plantain. Cartagena is a city here. Cartagena is an old city. It has colorful buildings. It is surrounded by a big wall.\n\nTo the east there is the Guajira desert. It is very dry. The Wayuu people live there. They make colorful bags. The biggest city is Cabo de la Vela. It is on the coast. There is good kite-surfing there.\n\nNow let’s go south. The elevation gets higher. The land becomes greener. It is colder. A city here is Medellin. It is in the mountains. It has cable-cars. These are like buses in the sky. At night, the mountains light up. It is the lights of houses. They look like stars.\n\nLet’s go further south. There is the Zona Cafetera. This means coffee-making region. There are many green hills. There are many small towns. Some towns are Salento, Jardin, and Finlandia. In these towns, people drink lots of tinto. This is black coffee with sugar. They drink it all day. They even drink it at night./n/nLet’s go further south. There is the Valle del Cauca. It is hot here. There are lots of sugar cane farms. These farms smell very good. The capital of the valley is called Cali. Cali is crazy about salsa. There is salsa music everywhere. There are over 200 salsa schools. There are even more discotecas. These are places where people dance at night.\n\nLet’s go west of Cali. There  is Buenaventura. Buenaventura is on the pacific coast. There are no roads to the Pacific coast. You have to go by boat. This makes it unique. There are lots of beaches. There are lots of jungles. There are not many people.\n\nLet’s go east of Cali. There are big mountains. They are above 9000 feet. The Purace volcano is above 15000 feet. Many people hike here.\n\nLet’s go further east. There is a valley. It is hot. It has a desert. It is called the Tatacoa desert. The stars are easy to see. There are cool rocks.\n\nColombia has a lot to offer. There is a lot I didn’t mention, too. There are the Llanos. These are ranch-lands. They are in the east. There’s also the Amazon. The Amazon covers 1/3 of the country. And there’s Bogota. Bogota is the nation’s capital. There is even more too. Maybe one day you will see some of it.",

It seems like all of these things couldn’t exist in one single country, right? Wrong. In Colombia, all of this and more can be found. Let’s take a trip around this diverse country and see what we find.\n\nLet’s start in the north. First there is the Caribbean coast. This region is very hot. It has beautiful beaches. The typical dish here is fish, rice with coconut, and pressed plantain. One of the most famous cities of this region is Cartagena. Cartagena is an old colonial city filled with colorful buildings. It is surrounded on four sides by a great wall from colonial times.\n\nTo the east there is the Guajira desert. It is a big piece of dry land and sand dunes. La Guajira is home to the Wayuu people. They are known for their colorful hand-made bags. The biggest city here is called Cabo de la Vela. It is on the coast at the edge of the desert. It is famous for its great kite-surfing.\n\nNow going south, we start to climb in elevation. The land becomes much greener and a bit colder. Eventually, we get to the beautiful city of Medellin. Medellin is a big city in the mountains. You can take cable-car rides between neighborhoods high above the city. At night time, you can see the lights of the houses in the mountains.

They drink it at all times of the day, even late at night.\n\nContinuing further south still, we get to the Valle del Cauca. This is a hot valley with lots of sugar cane farms. These farms give off a sweet, warm smell that welcomes everyone driving through. The capital of the valley is called Cali. It is known as the world’s capital of salsa. Cali is crazy about salsa. No matter what part of the city you’re in, you’ll probably hear salsa music coming from some restaurant. There are over 200 salsa schools in the city. There are even more discotecas where people dance every night of the week. \n\nTo the west of Cali is the port of Buenaventura. This is the gateway to Colombia’s pacific coast. There are almost no roads going to the Pacific coast. The only way to get to most places here is by boat. This makes the Pacific coast different from the rest of the country. Think of long stretches of black beaches and dark jungles with few people.\n\nTo the east of Cali there are big mountains. A lot of the land is above 9000 feet. The Purace volcano is above 15000 feet. Many people go to this region to hike and enjoy nature.\n\nFurther east, past the mountains, there is a hot valley. Here there is the Tatacoa desert.

Many people go to this region to hike and enjoy nature.\n\nFurther east still, the mountains drop off, giving way to an incredibly hot valley. This valley is home to the blindingly hot Tatacoa desert.

The movie was called Searching for Bobby Fischer. It was based on a book. Josh’s dad wrote the book. It was about Josh. Josh was famous. He didn’t like it. He wanted to play chess. Something else happened. Josh was 18. He got a new coach. Josh played aggressively. This coach made him play differently. He played less aggressively. Josh didn’t like this. It felt bad. He liked chess less.\n\nThen he started Tai Chi. He was 21. This was important. His life changed. He fell in love with it. He started competing. He became a national champion.  He won 5 national championships. He won a world championship. \n\nJosh learned from chess and Tai Chi. He wrote a book. The book is called The Art of Learning.\n\nHe also helps people learn.

By the time he was 9, he was the best chess player in the country for his age. At 11, he drew a game with Garry Kasparov, thought by some to be the greatest chess player of all time. Throughout his childhood and adolescence, Waitzkin was consistently the best chess player in the United States for his age and one of the best in the world.

This film was based on Josh’s father’s book about Josh’s early chess career. It’s release created mobs of fans, envious opponents, and mounting pressure.

By nature, Josh was an aggressive player who thrived on creating chaos on the board and then navigating through the chaos. At 18, Josh took on a teacher who forced him to study the more defensive masters of the game.

He started to notice many similarities between chess and Tai Chi. For example, the strategic sequences of moves he would practice in Tai Chi felt like chess strategies. As another example, he would deal with the great complexity in each art similarly. That is, he would focus on small details until they became second-nature to him. Then, he would forget about the details so that he could focus on the larger game. These are just two of many similarities.

Threes changed basketball.\n\nThere weren’t always threes. They started in 1945. It was a college game. Then they went to the NBA. This was in 1979. First people didn’t shoot many threes. Now they do.\n\nLet’s see why. The 3-point percentage is 36%. The 2-point percentage is 46%. Imagine a player shoots 100 shots. Let’s say he shoots threes. He’ll make about 36. So, he’ll have 108 points. What if he shoots twos? He’ll make about 46. So, he’ll have 92 points. So, shooting threes is good.\n\nThis has changed basketball. There are more layups and threes. There are fewer big centers. Teams spread out their offenses. They put more people outside. They put less inside. \n\nSome people like threes. They think threes are exciting. Threes make comebacks easier. \n\nOther people don’t like threes. They think threes are boring. They think threes aren’t basketball. Greg Popovich doesn’t like threes. He is the Spurs’ coach. He said, “I still hate it. I’ll never like it. I don’t think it’s basketball.”\n\nThrees are important. People will keep shooting threes. They might add 4-pointers. Steph Curry would like this.

    "article_text": "In basketball, shots are worth different amounts of points. It depends where you shoot from. If you make a basket from inside the “3-point line,” it’s worth 2 points. If you make one from outside the 3-point line, it’s worth 3 points. But it wasn’t always this way. In the beginning, every basket was worth two points. Later, the 3-point line was added. This rule change has had a big impact on basketball. It will impact the future of basketball too.\n\nFirst some history. The 3-point shot was first used in a college game in 1945. Then it was used in professional leagues. In 1979, it was used by the NBA. It has stuck ever since.\n\nThe use of threes has increased a lot. In 1979, teams shot just under 3 threes per game. Ten years later, they shot 6.5 per game. Today, they shoot 27 per game. \n\nLet’s see why. The 3-point percentage is 36%. The 2-point percentage is 46%. Imagine a player shoots 100 shots. Let’s say he shoots threes. Then he’ll make 36 on average. So, he’ll have 108 points. What happens if he shoots twos? Then, he’ll make 46 on average. So, he’ll have 92 points. So, it seems like a good idea to shoot threes.\n\nThe best teams realized this. Look at the 4 teams in the Conference Finals last year. The Warriors shot the least threes out of all four teams! They were 6th in the league in threes attempted. The other 3 teams were 1, 2, and 3. \n\nThis has changed the game. People don’t shoot from medium distance anymore. There are more layups and threes. There are fewer big centers. There are more slim big men who can shoot threes. Teams spread out their offenses more. They put more people on the perimeter. They put less people close to the basket. \n\nPeople have different opinions about threes. Some people like threes. They think threes are exciting. Also, threes make comebacks easier. Some people like that.\n\nOther people don’t like threes. Threes cause less teamwork. Threes also take away variety. Just threes and layups, with nothing in-between. Some people think threes aren’t basketball. Spurs coach Greg Popovich said, “I still hate it. I’ll never like it. I don’t think it’s basketball. I think it’s kind of like a circus sort of thing.”\n\nLike it or not, it seems the 3 is here to stay. It’s more important today than ever before. That’s not likely to change. They might even add a 4-point line. I’m sure Steph Curry wouldn’t mind. Would you?",
